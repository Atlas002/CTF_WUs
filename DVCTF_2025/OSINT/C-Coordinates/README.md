## Challenge Description:
You have been found by the OCBC (Office central de lutte contre le trafic des biens culturels - Central Office for Combating Trafficking in Cultural Property). To guarantee your freedom, you must cooperate: if you manage to provide all the information relating to the investigation, no charges will be brought against you.

While one of the security guards was doing his rounds, he noticed a strange inscription on one of the walls of the Sully wing on level 1.

"E 3023; N2290" 

Find the place of origin to which the inscription refers.
 
The flag is in the form: DVCTF{Place-Of-Origin}.  

## Write up
